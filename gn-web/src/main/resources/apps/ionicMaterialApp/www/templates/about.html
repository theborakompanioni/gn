                        How long has it been since you looked in the newspaper and read something good?

                        <br/>

                        Do you know that unpleasant feeling that takes over when you are constantly confronted
                        with bad stories, even when they do not personally affect you?

                        <br/>

                        Can you still smile after watching the news?

                        <br/>

                        This isn't healthy, and we can do better.

                        <br/>

                        This is Good News, an attention machine designed to keep you happy.
                        And it's very effective at what it does.

                        <br/>

                        Every day, smart and friendly people work to make the things you love the most,
